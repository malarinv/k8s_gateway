# k8s_gateway

A CoreDNS plugin that is very similar to [k8s_external](https://coredns.io/plugins/k8s_external/) but supporting all types of Kubernetes external resources - Ingress, Service of type LoadBalancer, HTTPRoutes, TLSRoutes, GRPCRoutes from the [Gateway API project](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/).

This plugin relies on its own connection to the k8s API server and doesn't share any code with the existing [kubernetes](https://coredns.io/plugins/kubernetes/) plugin. The assumption is that this plugin can now be deployed as a separate instance (alongside the internal kube-dns) and act as a single external DNS interface into your Kubernetes cluster(s).

## Description

`k8s_gateway` resolves Kubernetes resources with their external IP addresses based on zones specified in the configuration. This plugin will resolve the following type of resources:

| Kind | Matching Against | External IPs are from |
| ---- | ---------------- | -------- |
| HTTPRoute<sup>[1](#foot1)</sup> | all FQDNs from `spec.hostnames` matching configured zones | `gateway.status.addresses`<sup>[2](#foot2)</sup> |
| TLSRoute<sup>[1](#foot1) | all FQDNs from `spec.hostnames` matching configured zones | `gateway.status.addresses`<sup>[2](#foot2)</sup> |
| GRPCRoute<sup>[1](#foot1) | all FQDNs from `spec.hostnames` matching configured zones | `gateway.status.addresses`<sup>[2](#foot2)</sup> |
| Ingress | all FQDNs from `spec.rules[*].host` matching configured zones | `.status.loadBalancer.ingress` |
| Service<sup>[3](#foot3)</sup> | `name.namespace` + any of the configured zones OR any string consisting of lower case alphanumeric characters, '-' or '.', specified in the `coredns.io/hostname` or `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname` annotations (see [this](https://github.com/k8s-gateway/k8s_gateway/blob/master/test/single-stack/service-annotation.yml#L8) for an example) | `.status.loadBalancer.ingress` |
| DNSEndpoint<sup>[4](#foot4)</sup> | `spec.endpoints[*].targets` | |


<a name="f1">1</a>: Currently supported version of GatewayAPI CRDs is v1.0.0+ experimental channel.</br>
<a name="f2">2</a>: Gateway is a separate resource specified in the `spec.parentRefs` of HTTPRoute|TLSRoute|GRPCRoute.</br>
<a name="f3">3</a>: Only resolves service of type LoadBalancer</br>
<a name="f4">4</a>: Requires external-dns CRDs</br>

Currently, supports A and AAAA-type queries, all other queries result in NODATA responses.

This plugin is **NOT** supposed to be used for intra-cluster DNS resolution and does not contain the default upstream [kubernetes](https://coredns.io/plugins/kubernetes/) plugin.

## Install

The recommended installation method is using the helm chart provided in the repo:

```
helm repo add k8s_gateway https://k8s-gateway.github.io/k8s_gateway/
helm install exdns --set domain=foo k8s_gateway/k8s-gateway
```

Alternatively, for labbing and testing purposes `k8s_gateway` can be deployed with a single manifest:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k8s-gateway/k8s_gateway/master/examples/install-clusterwide.yml
```

## Configure

The only required configuration option are the zones that plugin should be authoritative for:

```
k8s_gateway [ZONES...]
```

Additional configuration options can be used to further customize the behaviour of a plugin:

```
{
k8s_gateway [ZONES...]
    resources [RESOURCES...]
    ingressClasses [CLASSES...]
    gatewayClasses [CLASSES...]
    serviceLabelSelectors SELECTOR [SELECTOR...]
    ttl TTL
    apex APEX
    secondary SECONDARY
    kubeconfig KUBECONFIG [CONTEXT]
    fallthrough [ZONES...]
    nodeAddressType [InternalIP|ExternalIP]
    clientFiltering [BOOL]
}
```

* `resources` a subset of supported Kubernetes resources to watch. Available options are `[ Ingress | Service | HTTPRoute | TLSRoute | GRPCRoute | DNSEndpoint ]`. If no resources are specified only `Ingress` and `Service` will be monitored
* `ingressClasses` to filter `Ingress` resources by `ingressClassName` values. Watches all by default.
* `gatewayClasses` to filter `Gateway` resources by `gatewayClassName` values. Watches all by default.
* `serviceLabelSelectors` to filter `Service` resources by labels using one or more [Kubernetes label selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors) strings. Each selector creates a separate watch; results are merged. Watches all by default.
* `ttl` can be used to override the default TTL value of 60 seconds.
* `apex` can be used to override the default apex record value of `{ReleaseName}-k8s-gateway.{Namespace}`
* `secondary` can be used to specify the optional apex record value of a peer nameserver running in the cluster (see `Dual Nameserver Deployment` section below).
* `kubeconfig` can be used to connect to a remote Kubernetes cluster using a kubeconfig file. `CONTEXT` is optional, if not set, then the current context specified in kubeconfig will be used. It supports TLS, username and password, or token-based authentication.
* `fallthrough` if zone matches and no record can be generated, pass request to the next plugin. If **[ZONES...]** is omitted, then fallthrough happens for all zones for which the plugin is authoritative. If specific zones are listed (for example `in-addr.arpa` and `ip6.arpa`), then only queries for those zones will be subject to fallthrough.
* `nodeAddressType` can be `InternalIP` (default) or `ExternalIP`. Selects which `Node` address type is used when resolving Node-backed hostnames. Useful when `ExternalIP` is the routable address clients should reach.
* `clientFiltering` if set to `true` (or bare `clientFiltering` with no argument), enables ECS-based answer filtering: when a query carries an [EDNS0 Client Subnet (ECS, RFC 7871)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7871) option, only the response IPs whose network falls within the client's subnet (as derived from the option's `Address` and `SourceNetmask`) are returned. The mask is taken from the ECS option itself — no separate mask knob is configured here. This is designed to pair with a recursive resolver that injects ECS on behalf of real clients (e.g. Blocky's `ecs` block) so that `k8s_gateway` returns only the site-local A record reachable from the client's subnet, instead of every load-balancer IP across every site. If no ECS option is present, or the option is malformed, the response is unchanged (fail-open). If filtering strips every address, the request follows the normal `fallthrough` behaviour — so roaming clients outside any known subnet still resolve via the next plugin / upstream. Disabled by default.

Example:

```
k8s_gateway example.com {
    resources Ingress
    ttl 30
    apex exdns-1-k8s-gateway.kube-system
    secondary exdns-2-k8s-gateway.kube-system
    kubeconfig /.kube/config
    clientFiltering true
}
```

### Required Kubernetes permissions

To monitor any of the resources `k8s_gateway` requires the following permissions in the cluster. If you installed using either the Helm chart of the `install-clusterwide.yml` manifest, a `ClusterRole`, `ClusterRoleBinding`, and `ServiceAccount` will have been added to allow monitoring `Ingress` and `Service` resources.

* **General CRDs**
  ```yaml
  - apiGroups:
      - apiextensions.k8s.io
    resources:
      - customresourcedefinitions
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
  ```
* **Ingress**
  ```yaml
  - apiGroups:
    - extensions
    - networking.k8s.io
    resources:
    - ingresses
    verbs:
    - list
    - watch
  ```
* **Service**
  ```yaml
  - apiGroups:
    - ""
    resources:
    - services
    - namespaces
    verbs:
    - list
    - watch
  ```
* **HTTPRoute, TLSRoute, GRPCRoute**
  ```yaml
  - apiGroups:
    - gateway.networking.k8s.io
    resources:
    - "*"
    verbs:
    - watch
    - list
  ```
* **DNSEndpoint**
  ```yaml
  - apiGroups:
    - externaldns.k8s.io
    resources:
    - dnsendpoints
    verbs:
    - get
    - watch
    - list
  - apiGroups:
    - externaldns.k8s.io
    resources:
      - dnsendpoints/status
    verbs:
      - "*"
  ```

## Excluding Specific Resources

In some cases, you may want to exclude specific Kubernetes resources from being processed by the `k8s_gateway` plugin. This can be useful when you have resources that should not be exposed via DNS or when you want to temporarily disable DNS resolution for certain objects.

### Using the Ignore Label

You can exclude any supported resource type by adding the `k8s-gateway.dns/ignore` label with the value `"true"` to the resource's metadata:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
  labels:
    k8s-gateway.dns/ignore: "true"  # This ingress will be excluded from DNS resolution
spec:
  # ... rest of spec
```

This label works for all supported resource types:
- **Ingress** resources
- **Service** resources (of type LoadBalancer)
- **HTTPRoute** resources
- **TLSRoute** resources  
- **GRPCRoute** resources
- **DNSEndpoint** resources

When a resource is excluded using this label, the plugin will not return it's address.

## Dual Nameserver Deployment

Most of the time, deploying a single `k8s_gateway` instance is enough to satisfy most popular DNS resolvers. However, some of the stricter resolvers expect a zone to be available on at least two servers (RFC1034, section 4.1). In order to satisfy this requirement, a pair of `k8s_gateway` instances need to be deployed, each with its own unique loadBalancer IP. This way the zone NS record will point to a pair of glue records, hard-coded to these IPs.

Another consideration is that in this case `k8s_gateway` instances need to know about their peers in order to provide consistent responses (at least the same set of nameservers). Configuration-wise this would require the following:

1. Two separate `k8s_gateway` deployments with two separate `type: LoadBalancer` services in front of them.
2. No apex override, which would default to `releaseName.namespace`
3. A peer nameserver's apex must be included in `secondary` configuration option
4. Glue records must match the `releaseName.namespace.zone` of each of the running plugin

For example, the above requirements could be satisfied with the following commands:

1. Install two instances of `k8s_plugin` gateway pointing at each other:
```
helm install -n kube-system exdns-1 --set domain=zone.example.com --set secondary=exdns-2.kube-system ./charts/k8s-gateway
helm install -n kube-system exdns-2 --set domain=zone.example.com --set secondary=exdns-1.kube-system ./charts/k8s-gateway
```

2. Obtain their external IPs

```
kubectl -n kube-system get svc -l app.kubernetes.io/name=k8s-gateway
NAME                  TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
exdns-1-k8s-gateway   LoadBalancer   10.103.229.129   198.51.100.1  53:32122/UDP   5m22s
exdns-2-k8s-gateway   LoadBalancer   10.107.87.145    203.0.113.11 53:30009/UDP   4m21s

```

3. Delegate the domain from the parent zone by creating a pair of NS records and a pair of glue records pointing to the above IPs:

```
zone.example.com (NS record) -> exdns-1-k8s-gateway.zone.example.com (A record) -> 198.51.100.1
zone.example.com (NS record) -> exdns-2-k8s-gateway.zone.example.com (A record) -> 203.0.113.11
```


## Build

## Release

## Hack

This repository contains a [Tiltfile](https://tilt.dev/) that can be used for local development. To build a local k8s cluster with kind run:

NOTE: if you're using something else other than docker please prefix the `make setup|up|nuke` commands with `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` or set CONTAINER_RUNTIME before executing them.

```
make setup
```

To bring up a tilt development environment run `tilt up` or:

```
make up
```

Some test resources can be added to the k8s cluster with:

```
# ingress and service resources
kubectl apply -f ./test/single-stack/ingress-services.yml

# gateway API resources
kubectl apply -f ./test/gateway-api/resources.yml
```

Test queries can be sent to the exposed CoreDNS service like this:

```
$ ip=$(kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.addresses[0].address}')

# ingress resource
$ dig @$ip -p 32553 myservicea.foo.org +short
198.51.100.0

# loadBalancer
$ dig @$ip -p 32553 test.default.foo.org +short
198.51.100.3

# HTTPRoute/gateway-API
$ dig @$ip -p 32553 myservicea.gw.foo.org +short
198.51.100.4
$ dig @$ip -p 32553 myserviceb.gw.foo.org +short
198.51.100.4

# multi-gateway HTTPRoute
$ dig @$ip -p 32553 myserviced.gw.foo.org +short
198.51.100.5
198.51.100.4
```

To cleanup local environment do:

```
make nuke
```
